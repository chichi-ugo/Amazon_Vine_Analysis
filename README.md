# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Exploring Big Data Analysis using Pyspark, Google Colab, Amazon AWS, and PostgresSQL

## Purpose
In this project, we aimed to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program in order to potentially undercover biases. Of the 50 available datasets, we will be looking specifically at the one of the books categories in this analysis. Our goal is to first use Pyspark to extract and transform the data. Then, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Finally, to return to Pyspark to do analysis that will help us determine whether there is bias towards favorable reviews.

## Results
